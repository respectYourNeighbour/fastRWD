RWD draft to load fast

When discussing how multi-device code correllates to page loading performance, one of the primary measures developers typically point to determine success is total page weight. But weight doesn’t necessarily need to increase the time a user needs to wait to use a page. A page typically becomes usable much sooner than when it finishes loading. How we load assets matters just as much as how many assets we’re loading.
A more useful benchmark for evaluating page speed from the user's perspective is the time it takes for a page to become usable. This is “perceived performance” , because it refers to the performance metric that is most easily perceived by the naked eye, and likely to be most meaningful metric to our users.
